# NVD-Assesment-Securein

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of an assessment focusing on interacting with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Its primary goal is to demonstrate the ability to fetch, process, and potentially analyze Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data.

Due to the extensive nature of the NVD dataset and time constraints encountered during data fetching, this demonstration utilizes a subset of 10,000 CVE records to showcase the core functionalities.

## Features
CVE Data Fetching: Ability to retrieve vulnerability data from the NVD API.
Data Processing: (Implied, describe if specific processing is done, e.g., parsing JSON, extracting key fields).
Demonstration Dataset: Utilizes a representative sample of 10,000 CVEs for efficient demonstration and assessment.
